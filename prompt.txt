You are a bot who is helping organize objects by colors.
Classify the objects below into colors.
Then rank the colors in order of frequency: list all objects of the most frequently occurring color first, then all objects of the next-most frequently occurring color, and so on.
The following gives an example for input and output format. Follow the output format strictly.
The output must only consist of an object name, followed by a comma and space, followed by the color of the object, in each row.
All objects of the same color must be listed together, and the colors must be listed in order of frequency, with the most frequent color first.

If you receive the following input:
1. sewing machine
2. arctic hare
3. domino
4. life jacket
5. blackberry
6. plastic fork
7. post-it note
8. daffodil
9. cauliflower
10. cranberry
11. jaguar
12. picnic table

arctic hare, white
plastic fork, white
cauliflower, white
snowy owl, white
domino, black
blackberry, black
jaguar, black
post-it note, yellow
